heading: This is the story of our journey
pgraph: The beginning of Good Shepherd Church
question: How did it all started?

heading1: The Idea Conception

pgraph1: Started in St.Michael & All Angel's Church
pgraph2: In the mid of 1970 the church attendance of St.Michael & All Angel's Church was increasing rapidly. Whenever there was a special service or event, the Church could not take in all the people. Many of them stand outside the Church during these events. The car park area also become a problem as members can't find a place to park their car. Thus the Parish Church Council realized that a bigger church was required to respond to the needs of present parishioners, and the further growth of the Church.
pgraph3: Ever since Bishop Yong Ping Chung (middle) was appointed Rector (then) of St.Michael Church in December, 1973 he had his vision of a Daughter Church but had kept in a secret and waited for the right moment for God to reveal His plan. On the 10th August, 1976, this idea of building a completely new Daughter Church was bought up in Parish Council Meeting and the vision was then shared to the rest of church members.
heading2: Searching Land
pgraph4: To build the Church we need a land which is increasingly difficult to find and costly to purchase. After searching for a year,we looked at two piece of land, but both did not materialize. Just when we were about to give up and settle for a house in a housing estate, God provided us a land (1.05 acres) which was situated at Mile 5, North Road was available and belong to a Church family. It is an ideal place because Tshun Nyen and Sibuga Housing Estate were already established. Other nearby estates were in the process of being developed. Thus the transfer of the land was completed in February 1978. Additional land (0.92 acres) was added (1979) to accommodate the Church, a Rectory, a Church Hall and other social amenities.

pgraph6: Now we have our land. Our next challenge is to raise building fund. Thus on 24th September, 1978, a group of committee was appointed and led by Rev. Yapp Foh Yu (chairman - third from left).
heading3: How we raise fund?
pgraph7: 1. A pledge card system requesting each church member (working adult) to pledge a month's salary or whatever amount he could afford as a symbol of "my gift to God".
pgraph8: 2. "RM100 a plate" Buffet Dinner was successfully launched on the evening of 15th December, 1979 at the Sabah Hotel. More than 300 guests attended, some are not Church members but wanted to show their support.
pgraph9: 3. Donations & Collections on St.Monica's and St.Gabriel's Day
pgraph10: 4. Through yearly Christmas Carolling (between 1978 and 1983).
pgraph11: 5. Women Fellowship contributed through their efforts in sales of food, sales of kindergarten uniforms and other handicrafts.
pgraph12: 6. Challenge by Datuk R.G.Barrett on 19th Oct, 1978 - He promised to give RM1 for every RM1 we gave to the Building Fund. His challenge would hold good for a period upto 31st December 1981 with the provision for extension of the dateline.
